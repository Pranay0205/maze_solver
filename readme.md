# Maze Solver

![Maze_Solver](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2aec95a5-dfa2-415d-b713-1a2cc1de71f4)

This project is a Python-based application that generates and solves mazes using currently limited to DFS pathfinding algorithms. It features an graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to visualize maze generation and solving processes.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Creates randomized mazes using algorithms such as Prim's or Kruskal's.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implements depth-first search (DFS) to find solutions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides a GUI to display the maze and animate the solving process.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pranay0205/maze_solver.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd maze_solver
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the GUI**:
   - Generate a new maze by selecting the desired size and generation algorithm.
   - Choose a solving algorithm (DFS or BFS) and visualize the solution path.
